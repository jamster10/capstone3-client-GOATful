# Laconic

Laconic enables Youtube creators to optimize their videos click rates by allowing them to rapidly test how their video appears on Youtube's search result page.  A creator can easily test out multiple custom thumbnails, titles, descriptions and more while seeing how the results render in desktop, iphone or android app.
