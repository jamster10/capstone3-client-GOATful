# Laconic

Laconic enables Youtube creators to optimize their videos click rates by allowing them to rapidly test how their video appears on Youtube's search result page.  A creator can easily test out multiple custom thumbnails, titles, descriptions and more while seeing how the results render in desktop, iphone or android app.

The code for the back end server can be found at [https://github.com/thinkful-ei-cheetah/capstone3-server-GOATful](https://github.com/thinkful-ei-cheetah/capstone3-server-GOATful).
